# COVID-19 STATISTICS

## Overview

> The **COVID-19 STATISTICS** app is a web app that gives a summary of updates on the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic across the world. The source of the data is from the [COVID-19 API](https://api.covid19api.com/summary) API. Every country is listed in the app with a detail page that shows the records of that particular country.
> ***Note:*** You may get Zero(0) new confirm cases for your country at a point in time. This because the API is yet to receive the confirm result from your country.
